this is to test the find and replace command of vi.

myf
hif
myf herf herf
myf
otf

the command is :%s/<text_to_search>/<text_to_replace_with>/g
the command "g" at the end of the line is optional it means globaly.

one can use the following perl command to replace text 
perl -pi -e "s/myf/nif/g" repl_test

Or one can use awk
awk '{gsub(/pattern/,"text_to_replace_with")}' input_file
One can even make it coloumn specific
awk '{gsub(/pattern/,"text_to_replace_with",$1)}' input_file

copy text in other file 
:3,8w tt
the above command will copy text from line 3 to 8 in a new file called tt
need to put "!" after :3,8w i.e :3,8w!  if the file tt already exists

plot "corr_vt_k015857" using 1:2
set logscale

one can unset logscale by using the following command
unset logscale y

plot [a:b][c:d] "data_file" using 1:2:3 w e

a,b are the xrange; c,d are the yrange

To move forward by one screen use "ctrl" + "f"
To move backward by one screen use "ctrl" + "b"
To goto the end of a file use "Shift" + g or G
To delete rest of a line use D

for highligh text or to show number type
:set number
:set hlsearch

To unset them type
:set nonumber
:set nohlsearch 

In gnuplot one can plot data corresponding to certain part 
of a file. To select the row range use
plot "file-name" every ::86::117 u 2:3

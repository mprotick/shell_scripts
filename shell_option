 a=`echo '11 + 2' | bc`
 b=`expr 11 + 2`
-n
   string is not null.

-z
  string is null, that is, has zero length


mkdir -p /foo/bar/baz  # creates bar and baz within bar under 
existing /foo

while read line; do echo "$line"; done < file.txt

#!/bin/bash
FILE=$1
while read line; do
     echo "This is a line : $line"
done < $FILE
 
awk '{print $1,"\t",$2}' input_file

head -157 ovhisq_new.tex | tail -34 > data

awk 'BEGIN {FS="&"} {print $2,$3}' data > data1

 awk '{print $1,"\t"$2,"\t"$1-$2,"\t"($1+$2)*0.5}' data2 >data3
awk '{print  $1,"\t"$2,"\t"$3,"\t"$4,"\t"$3*$4}' data3 > data4

 awk '{print $2,"\t" log($3)}' ps > ps_l

For more than one command at a time one can use
pwd ; ls

to know the size of a folder run
du -h /path/to/folder
this will list all the files in it. To see only the size run
du -sh /path/to/folder
or one can run
df -h /path/to/folder

to know the linux version run (works on any linux)
lsb_release -a

to open any file using its default application run
xdg-open <file>

For printing several files one after another one can use
cat file1 file2 > output_file

For printing the coloumns of two different files in a single
file use
paste file1 file2 > output_file

In order to redirect error message to another file type
<command> 2> err_msg

to extract data from some given row number to a particular row use
awk 'NR>2 && NR<8' input_file > output_file
awk 'NR>96 && NR<129 {print $2,"\t"$3}' out.ll.1200 > ps.ll.1200

In order to run a gnuplot script use
gnuplot input_file
or you can open gnuplot and use
load 'input_file'

In gnuplot to plot specific range (eg from row no. 100 to row no. 200)
plot "filename.txt" every ::100::200 using 1:2 with lines

 fit y(x) 'ps.1648.cb0.in.loc' every ::15::47 u 1:2 via A,m

tar -cf a.tar *
tar -xf st.tar

If you set logscale in gnuplot and want to see the ytics as 10^1,10^2
then use 
set format y "10^{%L}"
